## Major Scale

W-W-H-W-W-W-H

## Minor Scale

The minor scale is distinguished primarily by its mediant, which lies a half step lower than the third degree of the major mode.

- **Natural minor scale**: submediant ($\hat6$) and leading tone ($\hat7$) are a half degree lower than in major. W-H-W-W-H-W-W.
- **Harmonic minor scale**: raising the leading tone ($\hat7$) by a half step in natural minor scale. W-H-W-W-H-A-H.
- **Melodic minor scale**: raising the submediant ($\hat6$) and leading tone ($\hat7$) by a half step in natural minor scale. W-H-W-W-W-W-H.

## Identifying Key Signatures

In major, the tonic is the pitch one half step above the final sharp or the penultimate flat; in minor, the tonic lies three half steps below its relative major key.

## Intervals

The distance between the pitches in a **dyad** is an **interval**.

### Generic Intervals

The numerical label that identifies the distance between letter names is called the **generic** name. Notice that the first and last note SHOULD be included in counting. For example, A up to E is a fifth.

When one pitch follows another in time, the interval is called a **melodic interval**, or linear interval. If the two pitches sound simultaneously, the interval is called a **harmonic interval**.

Intervals no larger than the octave are called **simple intervals**. Intervals larger than the octave are called **compound intervals**.

### Specific Intervals

Specific intervals are grouped into two basic categories: **Perfect** (P) and **Major** (M)/**minor** (m).

- Specific intervals above $\hat1$ in the major scale: <img src="/assets/images/specificIntervals-major.png"/>
- Specific intervals above $\hat1$ in the minor scale: <img src="/assets/images/specificIntervals-minor.png"/>

Increasing the size of a major interval or perfect interval by a half step will result in an **augmented interval** (A or +); decreasing the size of a minor interval or perfect interval by a half step will result in a **diminished interval** (d or $\circ$).

**Diatonic intervals** are intervals found in major and minor mode. It includes all major/minor intervals, perfect intervals, and augmented fourth/diminished fifth.

#### Interval Inversion

When we move the lower pitch of a simple interval up one octave so that it is placed above the higher pitch, we have **inverted** the interval. Inversion also occurs when we place the higher pitch of a simple interval below the lower pitch.

#### Consonant and Dissonant Intervals

- **Consonant intervals**: diatonic forms of the unison, the third, the fifth (perfect only), the sixth, and the octave.
    - **Perfect consonances**: the perfect unison, the perfect octave, and the perfect fifth.
    - **Imperfect consonances**: the major and minor thirds and sixths.
- **Dissonant intervals**: the second, the seventh, and all diminished and augmented intervals. Notice that the perfect fourth is usually viewed as a dissonant interval.

## Simple and Compound Meters

Meters in which the beat is divided into twos are **simple meters**, while **compound meters** are meters in which the beat is divided into threes.

# Chapter 2: Introduction to Melody and Two-Voice Counterpoint

## Guidelines for Writing Melodies

1. Begin your melody on a member of the tonic triad ($\hat1$&ndash;$\hat3$&ndash;$\hat5$), and end it with the two-pitch pattern $\hat2$&ndash;$\hat1$ or $\hat7$&ndash;$\hat1$. The aproach to the final pitch by step is called a **melodic cadence**.
2. Limit the **range** of your melody (the total span of pitches) to the interval of a tenth, and set most of your melodic activity within a comfortable interval (**tessitura**) of about a sixth.
3. Move primarily by step, which is called **conjunct motion**.
4. You can also move with occasional skips (of thirds, fourths and fifths) to add interest; this is called **disjunct motion**. However, disjunct motion should:
    - be generally confined to small intervals, such as thirds, although you can use one or two larger leaps if they are no larger than a perfect fifth.
    - traverse consonant melodic intervals (i.e., no distant leaps, such as a diminished fourth).
    - resolve tensions. Some scale members have strong melodic pulls toward another member, usually the one lying a half step away. Such tendency tones create an important tension, but you should always resolve their tension. The most important tendency tone is the leading tone, which should ascend by step to $\hat1$ unless $\hat7$ is part of a descending melodic line $\hat8$&ndash;$\hat7$&ndash;$\hat6$&ndash;$\hat5$.
    - lead to a change of direction that fills in at least some of the musical space that was created by the leap, called the “law of recovery.” This is not essential for skips of a third, but it is mandatory with larger leaps, such as a fifth.
    - rarely use multiple skips one after the other. You can use two skips in a row if they are both thirds and if you change direction after the second skip.
    - avoid repeated notes and repetitive patterns, or *sequences* (for example, $\hat1$&ndash;$\hat2$&ndash;$\hat3$, $\hat2$&ndash;$\hat3$&ndash;$\hat4$, $\hat3$&ndash;$\hat4$&ndash;$\hat5$)&mdash;at least for now. Repeated notes create undesirable rhythmic groupings and rhythmic stagnation.
5. Aim for a logical shape. A melody commonly creates an arch that slowly rises to a single high point, or **melodic climax**, and then returns to the starting point.

## Two-Voice Counterpoint

Johann Fux developed a particularly succinct pedagogy that was used by many musicians including Mozart in teaching counterpoint.

Fux begins with a study of melody. In subsequent chapters he uses these melodies, called **cantus firmi** [“fixed songs”; singular: **cantus firmus** (**CF**)], as the structural pillars against which he teaches how to add first one voice, then two, and, still later three, creating a total of four parts.

Fux presents a series of five steps&mdash;or **species**&mdash;each of which isolates the way that an added voice would move against the CF. First-species counterpoint adds one pitch against each pitch in the CF; in two-species counterpoint, two pitches are written against a single pitch in the CF. Subsequent species add more pitches to the contrapuntal voice as well as new rhythmic procedures.

### First-Species Counterpoint

#### Contrapuntal Motions

1. Voices that move in opposite directions from one another create **contrary motion**. Contrary motion creates the most independence between voices. You should therefore incorporate it as much as possible.
2. Voices that move in the same general direction produce **similar motion**. Similar motion is most effective when using imperct consonances.
3. Voices that move in the same direction and maintain the same generic interval create **parallel motion**. You many only use imperct consonances (thirds and sixths) in parellel motions in order to maintain the independence and momentum of the two voices. Further, parallel motion in thirds or sixths should be limited to a maximum of three consecutive uses (6&ndash;6&ndash;6, or 3&ndash;3&ndash;3) in order to avoid monotony.

**Direct intervals** (also called **hidden intervals** or **similar intervals**) are created when approaching a perfect interval by similar motion.

#### Rules

1. Harmonic (vertical) intervals must be consonant. Notice that the perfect fourth is a dissonant interval in two-voice counterpoint.
2. Parellel perfect intervals (unisons, fifths, and octaves) are forbidden.
3. Approach perfect consonances using contrary motion; the single context in which similar motion is permitted occurs when the upper voice moves by step to the octave or fifth.
4. Begin and end your counterpoint on $\hat1$ (unless the counterpoint appears above the CF, when it may begin on $\hat5$).
5. In minor, use the lowered form of $\hat6$ and $\hat7$; raise $\hat7$ to create a leading tone only in the penultimate measure, and raise $\hat6$ when it precedes the leading tone.

Notice that the leaps allowed in first-species counterpoint are (thirds), fourths, fifths, ascending minor sixths and octaves.

#### Guidelines

1. Use step motion as much as possible in the contrapuntal voice, with occasional skips (jumps of a third) or leaps (jumps of a fourth or more) to add interest. Change direction and move by step after a leap.
2. Since the goal of counterpoint is voice independence, use contrary motion as much as possible. Parallel motion is restricted to imperfect consonances; limit to three consecutive uses.
3. Use imperfect consonances as verticalities when possible. Restrict the use of octaves and fifths to only one or two within the exercise.
4. Avoid two perfect consonances in a row since they create a hollow sound (e.g., a fifth to an octave, or vice versa).
5. Label every vertical interval.

### Second-Species Counterpoint

For every single note in the CF, there two in the contrapuntal voice. The contrapuntal motion of one voice moving while the other voice remains staionary is called **oblique motion**.

- **Strong beats**: where both the CF and the added counterpoint move to new pitches.
- **Weak beats**: where only the counterpoint moves to a new pitch against the sustained CF.

#### Weak-Beat Consonance

If we want to move to a weak-beat consonance by step, there is only one way to do it: by moving from a fifth to a sixth or a sixth to a fifth, which is called **5&ndash;6 technique**. The consonant second pitch may continue its motion to the next pitch in the same direction, in which case we call it a **consonant passing tone** (**CPT**), or it may return to the pitch heard on the downbeat, in which case we call it a **consonant neighbor tone** (**CNT**).

**Consonant skips** (**CS**) are motions by a third. **Consonant leaps** (**CL**) are motions by intervals larger than a third. To skip or leap, the weak-beat note must be consonant with both the preceding melody note and the CF. CS and CL are also possible from weak beat to the strong beat, but the majority of leaps occur *within* rather than *between*  measures.

#### Weak-Beat Dissonance

Second-species counterpoint uses a single type a dissonance: the **unaccented passing tone**. *Passing tones (PT) occur on a weak beat in 2:1 counterpoint, and they fill the space within the interval of a third, creating a smooth, stepwise motion*. In the following example, dissonant passing tones are marked; there are also consonant passing tones created using 5&ndash;6 technique.

<img src="/assets/images/wbD.png"/>

#### Rules

1. Strong beats must be consonant.
2. avoid parellel perfect intervals between：
    1. successive strong beats (downbeats).
    2. weak beat and strong beat (upbeat and downbeat).
3. Avoid direct motion to perfect intervals from weak to strong beats.
4. The only permitted dissonance is the weak-beat passing tone (i.e., the dissonance must fill the space of a melodic third by step between two downbeats).
5. The added voice must begin on $\hat1$ when it appears below the CF, but it may begin on $\hat1$, $\hat3$, or $\hat5$ when it appears above the CF. You may begin with a half rest, and the penultimate measure may contain either one or two pitches. The final measure must contain a whole note.
6. In minor, use the lowered form of $\hat6$ and $\hat7$; raise $\hat7$ to create a leading tone only in the penultimate measure, and raise $\hat6$ if it precedes the leading tone.

#### Guidelines

1. Incorporate as many dissonant passing tones as possible.
2. Use consonant leaps to balance dissonant passing tones.
3. Place leaps within, rather than between, measures.
4. Label every interval, and mark each dissonant passing tone with an asterisk.
